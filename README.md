# Send-and-Withdraw-ETH
This is a smart contract built in Solidity to send and withdraw ETH. I learned it from the  Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2025) course. This is a part of the practice project. I did some modification to the code to enable entering amount to be withdrawn.
